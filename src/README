Anomaly Detection
-----------------

A stream of data may contain anomalous values.  Suppose a service is queried
periodically and the response time captured.  What represents an anomalous value
for that response time?

One solution is to choose a data sample size, and measure the mean and standard
deviation of that sample, then look for values that lie outside a 1-sigma range
either side of the mean.


Usage
-----

The command line has three sections describing the input, the algorithm, and the
output:

    anomaly [algorithm] [reaction]

Algorithm
    -over                Trigger high value
    -under               Trigger low value

    -algorithm stddev    (default)
    -sample <size>       (default 24)
    -coefficient <coeff> (default 1.0)

    -algorithm threshold

Reaction
    -quiet
    -execute <program>
    -sigusr1 <pid>
    -log <file>

Suggestions
-----------

- percentiles
- truly ignore non-numeric inputs
